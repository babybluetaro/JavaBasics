Break :
break keyword breaks the loop
we always use break keyword with if condition once the condition is met
it stops the loop even if there are still iterations remaining
    if we use break we can save a lot of unnecessary processing
    by terminating the loop once the goal is complete

Continue:
Continue keyword is used to skip unnecessary calculation.
if an element meets a condition that element is skipped and
move to the next element

why should we use?
